# Overview of the project

Project:FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) DESIGN
 ![Shubh wave 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b990692-1854-48d5-8228-ef8e1c15aaa8)

# Objective

The objective is to design Finite State Machines (FSMs) using Verilog or VHDL in a VLSI software environment. 
This involves defining the states, inputs, outputs, and transitions of the FSM, implementing the design in 
Verilog or VHDL, and ensuring the FSM functions correctly through simulation and verification processes.
